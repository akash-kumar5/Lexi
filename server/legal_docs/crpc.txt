(2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specificname, the offence may be described in the charge by that name only.
(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any
specific name, so much of the definition of the offence must be stated
as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.
(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence
said to have been committed shall be mentioned in the charge.

is

(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a
statement that every legal condition required by law to constitute the
offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case.
(6)

The charge shall be written in the language of the Court.

(7) If the accused, having been previously convicted of any
offence, is liable, by reason of such previous conviction, to enhanced
punishment, or to punishment of a different kind, for a subsequent
offence, and it is intended to prove such previous conviction for the
purpose of affecting the punishment which the Court may think fit to
award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the
previous conviction shall be stated in the charge; and if such
statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at any time before
sentence is passed.
Illustrations
(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a
statement that A's act fell within the definition of murder given in
sections 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860); that it
did not fall within any of the general exceptions of the said Code;
and that it did not fall within any of the five exceptions to section
300, or that, if it did fall within Exception 1, one or other of the
three provisos to that exception applied to it.

910
(b)A is charged under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860),
with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B by means of an instrument
for shooting. This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not
provided for by section 335 of the said Code-, and that the general
exceptions did not apply to it.
(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery
or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-mark. The charge
may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or
extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or that he used a
false property-mark, without reference to the definitions of those
crimes contained in the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860); but the
sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance,
be referred to in the charge.
(d)A is charged under section 184 of the Indian Penal Code(45 of 1860)
with intentionally obstructing a sale of property offered for sale by
the lawful authority of a public servant.The charge should be in those
words.
212.
Particulars as to time, place and person.
212.Particulars as to time, place and person. (1) The charge
shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged
offence, and the person (if any) against whom, or the thing (if any)
in respect of which, it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to
give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.
(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or
dishonest misappropriation of money or other movable property, It
shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be,
describe the movable property in respect of which the offence is
alleged to have been committed, and the dates between which the
offence is alleged to have been committed, without
specifying
particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall be
deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of section
219;
Provided that the time included between the first and
such dates shall not exceed one year.

213.When manner of committing offence must be stated. When the
nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned in sections
211 and 212 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter

with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such
particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed
as will be sufficient for that purpose.

the

215.Effect of errors. No error in stating either the offence or
particulars required to be stated in the charge, and no omission

to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any
stage of the case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled
by such error or omission, and it has occasioned a failure of justice.
Illustrations
(a)A is charged under section 242 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of
1860), with "having been in possession of counterfeit coin, having
known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was
counterfeit," the word "fraudulently" being omitted in the charge.
Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the
error shall not be regarded as material.
(b)A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he
cheated B is not set out in the charge, or is set out incorrectly.
A
defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the
transaction.
The Court may infer from this that the omission to set
out the manner of the cheating is not material.
(c)A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he
cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many transactions
between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the
charge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may inter from
such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating
was, in the case, a material error.
(d)A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st
January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was Haidar
Baksh
and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never
charged with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the
Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh:
The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and that
the error in the charge was immaterial.
(e)A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January,
1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the
21st January 1882. When charged for the murder of Haider Baksh, he
was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his
defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may
infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was material.

(3)If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that
proceeding immediately with the trial is not likely, in the opinion of
the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor
in the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after
such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as
if the altered or added charge had been the original charge.
(4)If the alteration or addition is such that
proceeding
immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to
prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may
either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may
be necessary.
(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one
for the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary, the case
shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless
sanction has been already obtained for a prosecution on the same
facts as those on which the altered or added charge is founded.

altered or added to by the Court after the commencement of the trial,
the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed(a) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to
such alteration or addition, any witness who may have been
examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in
writing, considers that the prosecutor or the accused, as the
case may be, desires to recall or re-examine such witness for
the purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of
justice ;

think to be material.

219.Three offences of same kind within year may be charged
together. (1) When a person is accused of more offences than one of
the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the
first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same
person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, any
number of them not exceeding three.
(2) Offences are of the same kind when they are punishable with
the same amount of punishment under the same section of the Indian
Penal Code (45 of 1860) or of any special or local law :
Provided that, for the purposes of this section, an offence
punishable under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)shall
be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an offence punishable
under section 380 of the said Code, and that an offence punishable under
any section of the said Code, or of any special or local law, shall be
deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an attempt to commit such
offence, when such an attempt is an offence.
220.
Trial for more than one offence.
220.Trial for more than one offence.
(1) If, in one series of
acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more
offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged

with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence.
(2) When a person charged with one or more offences of criminal
breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of property as provided
in sub-section (2) of section 212 or in sub-section (1) of section
219, is accused of committing, for the purpose of facilitating or
concealing the commission of that offence or those offences, one or
more offences of falsification of accounts, he may be charged with,
and tried at one trial for, every such offence.
(3) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two
or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by
which offences are defined or punished, the person accused of them may
be charged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences.
914
(4) If several acts, of which one or more than one would by
itself or themselves constitute an offence, constitute when combined a
different offence, the person accused of them may be charged with, and
tried at one trial for the offence constituted by such acts when
combined, and for any offence constituted by any one, or more, of such
acts.
(5) Nothing contained in this section shall affect section 71 of
the Indian
Penal Code (45 of 1860).

221.Where it is doubtful what offence has been committed. (1) If
a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful
which of several offences the facts which can be proved will
constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or
any of such offences, and any number of such charges may be tried at
once; or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed
some one of the said offences.
(2) If in such a case the accused is charged with one offence,
and it appears in evidence that he committed a different offence for
which he might have been charged under the provisions of sub-section
(1), he may be convicted of the offence which he is shown to have
committed, although he was not charged with it.

proved against the offender, if it appears to the Court before which
he is convicted, regard being had to the age, character or antecedents
of the offender, and to the circumstances in which the offence was
committed, that it is expedient that the offender should be released
on probation of good conduct, the Court may, instead of sentencing him
at once to any punishment, direct that he be released on his entering
into a bond with or without sureties, to appear and receive sentence
when called
974

upon during such period (not exceeding three years) as the Court may
direct and in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good behaviour:

Magistrate of the second class not specially empowered by the High
Court, and the Magistrate is of opinion that the powers conferred by

such Magistrate, who shall dispose of the case in the manner provided

further inquiry or additional evidence on any point to be necessary,
he may make such inquiry or take such evidence himself or direct such
inquiry or evidence to be made or taken.

in a building, dishonest misappropriation, cheating or any offence
under the Indian Penal Code(45 of 1860), punishable with not more than

no previous conviction is proved against him, the Court before which
he is so convicted may, if it thinks fit, having regard to the age,
character, antecedents or physical or mental condition of the offender
and to the trivial nature of the offence or any
extenuating
circumstances under which the offence was committed, instead of
sentencing him to any punishment, release him after due admonition.
(4) An order under this section may be made by any Appellate
Court or by the High Court or Court of Session when exercising its
powers of revision.
(5) When an order has been made under this section in respect of
any offender, the High Court or Court of Session may, on appeal when
there is a right of appeal to such Court, or when exercising its
powers of revision, set aside such order, and in lieu thereof pass
sentence on such offender according to law:
Provided that the High Court or Court of Session shall not under
this sub-section inflict a greater punishment than might have been

conditions of his recognizance, it may issue a warrant for his
apprehension.
(9) An offender, when apprehended on any such warrant, shall be
brought
forthwith before the Court issuing the warrant, and such
Court may either remand him in custody until the case is heard or
admit him to bail with a sufficient surety conditioned on his
appearing for sentence and such Court may, after hearing the case,
pass sentence.

Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 (20 of 1958), or the Children Act,
