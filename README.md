# Lexx - AI-Powered Legal Chat & Research Assistant
Lexx is an LLM + RAG–powered legal AI built for Indian laws.
Ask complex legal questions and get context-aware, citation-backed answers — fast.
Input a few key details, and Lexx auto-generates structured drafts with relevant Act references, ready to export as PDF.

This is my proof-of-work project — a solo effort to streamline legal workflows using AI and automation.

# Features (Beta version)
- Legal Q&A Chat – Get precise answers grounded in Indian statutes, sections, and acts.
- RAG-Powered Context Retrieval – Pulls relevant legal references from a curated knowledge base.
- Act Reference Mapping — Automatically cites relevant Indian Acts for each template.
- Prompt-based Drafting Interface — Simple prompt UI to guide users through document creation.
- Multi-Conversation Support – Keep and revisit separate chat threads.
- Fast & Modern UI – Responsive Next.js frontend, optimized for speed.

 # In Progress
Scene-to-Draft Matching – Users will be able to describe a legal scenario in plain language, and Lexx will find the most relevant draft example with maximum specificity, using LLM-powered semantic search + RAG.
